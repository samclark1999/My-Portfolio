## About
My-Portfolio is a personal website I have developed for my career. It has a custom domain that is secured by https and managed with S3, Route53, and Cloudfront from Amazon Web Services. This project was developed using the React framework as well as other technologies. (see next section) I also made this website responsive for different screen resolutions using custom css media quereies.
